      <h1>Factors affecting High School Graduation Rates</h1>
      <h3>Objective:</h3>
      <p>For this project, I would like to explore some of the factors influencing the graduation rates of students. This would include things like school funding, student to teacher ratio, neighborhood crime, average household income, etc. Right now I think it would be best to focus on a single school district. The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) seems like a good choice because it is pretty big and we will be able to find a lot of data from the city. I'm thinking of using a map to show the data.</p>
